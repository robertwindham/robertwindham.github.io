									<h3 class="major">Undergraduate</h3>
									<p>During my undergraduate years at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, I graduated with <i>Magna Cum Laude</i> honors, with a GPA of 3.7. I developed a newfound love of birds from my Ornithology class and gained hands on experience volunteering for various rehabilitators during my Wildlife Education and Rehabilitation course. Courses like Ecology, Evolution, and Global Change Biology furthered my interest towards the field of conservation.

<h3 class="major">Graduate</h3>
									<p>At Austin Peay State University, I am on the nonthesis track with a standing GPA of 3.94. Learning about the loss of once abundant grasslands that covered vast areas across the southeast from courses like the Natural History of the Mid-South forever changed the way I interpret our region's habitats, especially in regard to the proper land mangement of areas that have historically experienced regular disturbance. Courses like Methods of Biological Research, Conservation Biology, and Advanced Data Analytics helped me gain experience coding in R software ranging from its introductory applications to detailed model and spatial analysis. Through collaboration with other graduate students, I assisted with data collection for grassland vegetation surveys and also conducted point counts/area searches for my independent study investigating the habitat use of White Throated Sparrows on campus. With my independent study and another GIS course, I gained experience mapping in ArcGIS Pro as well.
